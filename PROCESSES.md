## Proposing Initiatives or Activities

We encourage members to bring forward new ideas for PTA initiatives, events, or activities that can benefit our school community.

*   **Initial Discussion:** You can discuss your idea informally with a PTA committee member or officer, or bring it up during the 'New Business' section of a PTA meeting.
*   **Formal Proposal (if needed):** For larger initiatives, you may be asked to submit a brief written proposal outlining:
    *   The objective of the initiative.
    *   Potential benefits to the students/school community.
    *   Estimated resources required (e.g., volunteers, budget).
    *   Your contact information.
*   **Review Process:** Proposals will be reviewed by the relevant PTA committee or the executive board. You will be contacted regarding the status of your proposal.

## Decision-Making Process (Overview)

*   **Meetings:** Most decisions are discussed and voted upon during regular PTA meetings. Meeting schedules and agendas are circulated in advance.
*   **Quorum:** A minimum number of members (as defined in the PTA Charter) must be present for a vote to be valid.
*   **Voting:** Decisions are typically made by a simple majority vote of members present, unless otherwise specified in the Charter (e.g., for amendments to the charter or election of officers).
*   **Committees:** The PTA has several committees (e.g., Events, Fundraising, Communications) that may make recommendations or decisions within their specific areas of responsibility, as delegated by the executive board or general membership.

## Volunteering

Our PTA thrives on the support of volunteers!

*   **Opportunities:** Look out for announcements regarding volunteer needs for specific events or ongoing activities.
*   **Sign-up:** Sign-up sheets or online forms will be made available for volunteer registration.
